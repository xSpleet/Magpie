Did you ever want to have a little speed boost for your exploration mission? Have you ever wanted to become much more powerful than your friends in your multiplayer world? Have you always found roguelike mechanics fun and exciting? Or are you like a magpie and is collecting stuff your passion? 
If the answer to any of these questions is yes, you should try this mod! It has a lot (currently 36) of artifacts for you to find, collect and use! The effects of these artifacts range from giving you a small speed boost to giving you creative flight in certain conditions! These artifacts are scattered around the world and are waiting for you to find them!

## Gameplay

Every player has 6 passive artifact slots and 1active artifact slot. You cannot have the same artifact equipped twice. 

Let’s start with finding your first artifact! They are scattered through the worlds, appearing in almost every structure. Different structures contain different artifacts, so it’s worth it to explore various structures and dungeons.

Some other artifacts are obtained through trading or drops from entities or blocks.

## Passive Artifacts

Try mining some stone. If you’re lucky, you’ll get a Lucky Pebble! Wow, your first artifact! If you look at the tooltips you’ll find a small desription and an explanation of how the artifact works.

Equip it! You can find the slots in your inventory. They should be near your offhand slot and are marked with a shiny coin. 

As soon as you equip the artifact, its effect is working. Lucky Pebble is a passive artifact giving you more attack strength. Other artifacts have stronger effects, like conditional creative flight or double jump!

## Active Artifacts

The bonuses (and negatives) of passive artifacts are active all the time - as soon as you equip them, you are good to go.  

Active artifacts are different. Active artifacts go in a different slot, which is marked by a coin with lightning, have a recharge time and don’t give you a constant effect. You have to use them to get the bonus. You can do that by pressing ‘U’.

Remember the recharge time? It is the time you need to wait before using the active artifact again.
